## Description

This is my AI course final project. I implemented a connect-4 game with a GUI and a simple AI. 
The AI uses the **minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning to find the best move and **reinforcement learning**.

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/ILoveBacteria/connect-4/wiki) for more information about the project and 
how implemented the heuristic function and the Q-Learning.

## How To Run The Project

1. You have to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) and 
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the terminal in the project folder and run these commands to install dependencies.
   ```shell script
   pipenv install
   npm install
   ```
   
4. Run this `npm` command to build the project.
   ```shell script
   npm run build
   ```
   
5. Run this `pipenv` command to run the Flask server.
   ```shell script
   pipenv run server
   ```
   
6. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Train the AI

In the Q-Learning 2 agents play against each other. At the end of each game, the winner agent will be rewarded with 
`1000` and the loser agent will be punished with `-1000`. If the game ends with a draw, both agents will be rewarded `0`.

`connect_4` package provides a CLI. You can use it to train the AI. It will create `q_table.csv` file if it doesn't exist. 
If it exists, it will load the Q-Table from it and continue training.

The Q-Table has 4 columns. The first 3 columns are the state of the board and action, and the last column is the Q-Value.

```shell script
pipenv run python -m connect_4 train --count-games 10
```
